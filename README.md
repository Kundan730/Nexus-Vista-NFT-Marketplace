## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

NEXUS VISTA is a crowd source NFT Marketplace in which an individual can purchase High value NFT at low cost.

Crowd-Sourcing Model: A crowd-sourcing model typically involves the collective efforts and contributions of many individuals. In the context of NFTs, this could mean that users collectively determine the value of NFTs, set prices, or even create NFTs through contributions.

LOW COST WORKING: It basically divide the NFT in fractions. For eg. one want to purchase an NFT but its of RS.1000 and it feels high value for him so our portal gather same people interested for that and will combine their money in equal amounts ie.: 10 persons so 100 per head so the rate by which NFT will increase by same their fraction of money will increase.

WHY NFT ::: 
Fractional NFTs are designed to enhance liquidity and access to high-value NFTs, as they allow people to invest in or speculate on a portion of an expensive NFT rather than needing to own the entire thing. This concept doesn't violate the non-fungibility of the original NFT but complements it by making NFT ownership more accessible and tradable.

## Usage

Art Ownership:
High-value art NFTs can be fractionalized, allowing multiple art enthusiasts to collectively own and appreciate the artwork. This democratizes art ownership, making it more inclusive space. You may also link to more resources.

Collectibles and Memorabilia:

Collectible NFTs, such as sports memorabilia or rare trading cards, can be shared among a group of collectors, making it more affordable for fans to participate in the ownership of rare items.

High-Value NFT Portfolios:

Investors can create diversified portfolios of high-value NFTs, including digital art, virtual real estate, and collectibles, by purchasing fractions of multiple NFTs within a single platform.

Liquidity and Trading:

Fractional ownership of NFTs can enhance liquidity as users can trade their ownership shares in the secondary market. This liquidity can make it easier to buy and sell NFT fractions.
